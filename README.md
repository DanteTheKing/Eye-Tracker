# Toony Eye — Interactive Browser Extension

A fun little animated eye that follows your cursor, blinks in cool styles, changes color, and reacts to light and dark!  
Made just for fun — no big goals, just vibes. Works on Microsoft Edge and Chrome.

## Features

- Eye tracks your mouse cursor smoothly
- Multiple blinking styles (slow blink, fast blink, squint)
- Random eye colors to keep it fresh
- Pupil changes size based on time of day (simulating light/dark)
- Lightweight and easy on your browser

## Installation
